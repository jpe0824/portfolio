        <h3>Creative developer and life-long learner</h3>

        <p>
          I have always loved tech and making things. When I was younger it came
          in the form of video games like minecraft or some city builder or even
          Legos. Building in a digital space came naturally. A few years into a
          sales career and some un-forseen global events, (*cough) I started to
          play around with computer programming. I was instantly hooked. I
          started classes right away and haven't really looked back since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have been focused on completing my degree and
          contributing as a developer. My current position has taught me a lot
          in the front end and I am currently sharpening my skills to work as a
          full stack dev.
        </p>
        <h4>As a developer</h4>
        <p>
          I pride myself in putting the best code forward. I take time to ensure
          my code is <b>readable</b> and <b>maintainable</b>. I am always
          willing to take feedback and use that to improve my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always excited to start a new project. I look to learn something
          new and am happy to lead the way when needed.
        </p>
        <h4>As a colleague</h4>
        <p>
          Communication is key. With my background in sales I have learned to
          communicate with <b>every</b> type of person. I am always happy to
          voice my opinion or welcome others' as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a team player and happy to help my peers when needed. I prefer to
          go into what I call <em>code mode</em> (blast music for a couple hours
          and vigorously type away) but when needed, jumping on a call to break
          down a complicated problem can be just as fun.
        </p>
        <h4>As a person</h4>
        <p>
          Work life balance is very important to me. One of the things that
          gravitated me to this career was just that. When doing sales I often
          found myself burned out and performing sub-optimally in my work and
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make sure to take time for my family and myself. It puts me in a
          great place mentally and because of that I am able to produce and
          out-perform expectations.
